Validate legaly your forms created with main plugins in the market.

== Description ==

Your clients will be able to sign any document through a form that you insert in your website with WordPress.

And the signed document will have full legal validity.

Firmafy is an advanced electronic signature system that collects 6 evicendes to guarantee the signatory identity and the signed document validity.

The document is generated as a result of the data inserted by your clients in your WordPress form.

Firmafy connects with the most popular and reliable WordPress form plugins:

- [Contact Form](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) (free version).
- [Gravity Form](https://www.gravityforms.com/pricing/).

And it can be also connected with your [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

**How does the Firmafy plugin work?**

1. Create an account on [Firmafy](https://firmafy.com/solicitud-plan-gratuito-firmafy-planfree/?utm_source=plugin&utm_medium=enlace&utm_campaign=plugin_wordpress_firmafy).
2. Download your Firmafy plugin and connect it with [Contact Form](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) or [Gravity Form](https://www.gravityforms.com/pricing/).
3. Create a template with Firmafy with the document you need to have signed.
4. Create a form with Contact Form or Gravity Form and publish it on your website. And ready to work!

Once your client fills out the form, a document will be generated with their data on it. That document will arrive ready to be signed straight away to their email.

The signature process will start as soon as your client clics on the email link.

Both of you will receive an email with the signed document copy. That signature will have a full legal validity.
